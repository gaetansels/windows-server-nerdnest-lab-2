## FILESERVER

CONTEXT : 

First, we are going to add a file server to the domain. A file server is a member server in this domain.
A member server is a device that runs the Windows Server software. It is part of the domain, but it is not a domain controller. 
Meaning it has no copy of the Active Directory. 
The file server is connected to the domain because we will configure permissions based on the users in the Active Directory. 

The first thing we are going to do is update the lab environment by adding a member server. 
This is done by adding a full clone to the lab of an already installed Windows server in VMware. 
It can be a full clone because it is a fresh server before configurations, making it easier.
